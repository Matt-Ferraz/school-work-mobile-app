# Flutter school AI's app

## Summary

### The idea is creating an app for students ask questions about subjects that they can choose on the mobile app. The response is integrated with [`openAI API`]("https://openia.com/api"), handled by mine [`Node.JS api`]("https://github.com/Matt-Ferraz/api-school-chat-app") avaiable on github.
